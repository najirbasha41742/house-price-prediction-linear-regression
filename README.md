## Introduction

House price prediction involves estimating the market value of a property based on various influencing factors. Linear Regression is used to build a relationship between independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (price) in a simple and interpretable way.

## Abstract

- Developed a predictive model using Linear Regression.
- Used historical data including size, rooms, location, and amenities.
- Performed preprocessing like normalization and handling missing values.
- Evaluated performance using **MSE** and **R² Score**.
- Compared with other regression models for accuracy.
- Highlighted key features affecting price through model coefficients.

## Proposed Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Historical house data with key features.
2. **Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
3. **Feature Selection** – Identifying the most impactful features.
4. **Train-Test Split** – Dividing dataset to train and evaluate the model.
5. **Model Training** – Applying Linear Regression.
6. **Evaluation** – Metrics: MSE and R² Score.
7. **Prediction & Optimization** – Fine-tuning for improved results.

## Tools and Frameworks

**Language**: Python  
**Libraries**:
- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `numpy` – Numerical computations
- `scikit-learn` – Model building & preprocessing
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Visualization

---

## Results & Evaluation

- Model performance evaluated using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R² Score**
- Provided clear insights into key factors driving house prices.
- Compared results with advanced models like decision trees and random forests.

---

## Conclusion

- Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful tool for predicting house prices.
- Works well with clean, structured data.
- Interpretability makes it ideal for understanding market trends.
- May underperform on highly complex, non-linear datasets.
- Can be improved using techniques like **Ridge** or **Lasso Regression**.
